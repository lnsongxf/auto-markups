/*
Note: see 1991 Acura Integra. The three trims are identical according to my data.
However, the pricemsrp differs. So it must be non-structural things about the car, like
leather, sound system, etc. (actually, the more expensive one is 50lbs heavier, so it might have
a spoiler?).
You could think of the the higher trims representing the demand for leather interiors, not
a fundementally different car.
